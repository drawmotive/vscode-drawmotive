## 💡 Features

### Smart File Format

Drawmotive uses a revolutionary file format that's both a **valid PNG image** and a **full diagram**:

- **Share anywhere** - Works as a regular PNG in emails, Slack, GitHub, etc.
- **Embedded data** - All diagram information stored invisibly in PNG metadata
- **Single file** - No separate `.json` or data files to manage
- **Version control** - Commit to Git like any other image

### Developer Workflow Integration

```bash
# Works seamlessly with Git
git add docs/architecture.draw.png
git commit -m "Update architecture diagram"

# View in any image viewer
open diagram.draw.png

# Edit in VS Code
code diagram.draw.png
```

### Example Use Cases

**Software Teams:**
- Document microservices architecture
- Explain API flows in pull requests
- Design database schemas
- Create onboarding documentation

**Technical Writers:**

- Infrastructure diagrams
- Network topology maps

## 📋 Requirements

- **VS Code**: Version 1.95.0 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Internet**: Not required (works offline)

## 🎓 How It Works

1. **Create** - Use drawing tools to create your diagram
2. **Save** - Click **Save diagram** to export as PNG with embedded diagram data in tEXt chunk

4. **Edit** - Open the PNG in Drawmotive to continue editing

The magic? Your diagram data is stored in standard PNG metadata chunks, making files portable and future-proof.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22 or newer. Install the published editor and build the extension:

```bash
npm ci
npm run compile
npm test
npm run lint
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

The exact `@drawmotive/editor` version and npm registry integrity are locked in
`package-lock.json`. Each compile verifies and stages the package runtime under
ignored `dist/editor/`; the VSIX includes those assets for offline editing. No
.NET build or private editor checkout is required. Upgrade the dependency and
lockfile together, then compile again.

Press F5 to launch the extension. Use **Save diagram** above the editor to write
the PNG preview and editable document back to the `.draw.png` file. The extension
serves packaged assets on a temporary loopback port because the browser SDK
requires HTTP origins; VS Code resolves the client URL for remote extension hosts. Desktop VS Code and remote tunnels still require manual verification.

Release scripts still enforce `.release/target.json`; the already-published
0.2.1 Marketplace version remains deferred until a future release is enrolled.
